cap-6:	Beautiful. Pondered the design of the butter dispensor. Was it deliberately shaped as such? If not, was it inherently in the soul of the engineer? Japanese have it in them. You can see it everywhere. I want to believe design wasn't a priority here. It's just there by virtue of Japan. Every little thing. I think design wasn't a priority because it's a butter packet. And because constant emotional design thinking is expensive for the mind. Can't spread it too thin, over everything. Butter can't have it. Maybe? Now that I write this, I realize this could be Korean butter too. Either way, both have similarities. I think Korea has better deliberate design, but Japan has better inherent, innate design.

Was quite sad on my way to Itcheon Airport. Though, I forgot to mention the place I was staying had bed bugs, i think.. So it was a relief. Though, I really felt at home in Seoul. I've made so many friends, and learnt so much, from so many keen and interesting individuals from literally all over the world. Many faces lest I forget. 

I've since kept up my Korean as much as I can. I couldn't remember any Japanese in Korea, though once landed in Japan, I was (somehow) able to recall virtually everything I've learnt when I'd first landed in Japan 2 weeks prior. Not to mention my confidence concerning my inability to speak has already been beaten in Korea, it was easier this time to say thank you, good day, and so on. 

Anyway, that night, I found myself in Shibuya for a gander. Later felt tired and retired to the HQ.
