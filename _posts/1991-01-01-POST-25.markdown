Today I'm going to the design festival. On my way, as I write this, birds here sound like tiny screeching monkeys. I want to appreciate nature and it's wonders, but frankly they sound.. unpleasant.. to say so kindly. 

I'm not at SevenEleven. Met some really great people at the festival. My nails are dirty. Since my trip, I've drastically my nail biting habits. Nearly to a full halt. Perhaps the lack of stress be good for the nails. 

Bought some coasters from 3 great korean designers. They started their business just this past summer and seemed to have a very impressive stack of work already, to be sold. Many many students here too, presenting work. Lots of fantastic furniture design as well. Some are shy to talk about their work, mostly because of the language, but still, many can speak some English :) and a few, quite well.  

You can easily clear the festival in maybe 2-3 hours if you go quickly enough, but I will have to return. I was too slow, talking with many people. I was here maybe 6-7 hours. I contemplated bringing a friend, though for their sake, i'm glad I didn't >.>
