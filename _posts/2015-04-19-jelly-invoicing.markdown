A flexible solution for producing invoices and keeping them neatly organized on your local or shared drive.

Extending <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>'s ability to easily create static web pages with it's blog-aware features, Jelly has been adapted to output invoices in place of blogs. Jelly calculates for you, hourly or fixed pricing, with or without tax needs.

<b>Version 1.0</b><br>
Check out the <a href="http://mrurka.github.io/jelly-invoice-website/" target="_blank">Website</a> for download info, or check out the <a href="http://mrurka.github.io/jelly-invoice/" target="_blank">Demo</a>.

<b>Version 2.0</b><br>
Plans for version 2.0 include the ability to import your invoice design from Adobe Illustrator and have Jelly automatically make a fully-functional template out of it, at <b>very</b> high fidelity, in an instant.
