Hit up the National War Museum. Frankly disappointed compared to the one we have in Ottawa. My xenophillia led me to believe it was going to magnitudes better. Although I did get to see a Soviet T-34 and SU-100. Very very cool, and a T-59. Beautiful Soviet tanks the Soviet Union supplied North Korea during the north and south war. Kim Jung-il even asked permission to Stalin if he could go to war, and would only sanction the war if Mao (Communist leader of China) agreed to support the war as well. Mao finally and reluctantly agreed to back the war and even support North Korea if the US ever took part on Korean Soil. My brief history lesson. Also, when North Korea was forced to retreat, the committed many atrocities and abducting over 100,000 South Koreans. The young men to fight, and the elderly to labour camps. 

American2 and I went out with Anna and Vivian, Korean and Chinese, very kind. Though sadly Anna and myself forgot to bring our ID's. Not too big of a deal for me, maybe 30 minute commute total, but Anna lives in Itcheon, the airport Island. About an hour away, so she left, we all split up and I met up with Rachel, Feminist. Gentle and hard to figure out.

I'm like an NES with an old game.
