cap-15:	Went back to that Owl bar. I was the only white guy there, but still went well. Dancing is the way in. Especially when you can't really speak to anyone.. Lol

cap-20:	This is actually the first photo..... I've not done anything today. Woke up on the couch, i think. Haven't stopped shaking yet, and it's 5:00PM. Two nights in a row, ending at around 5:00AM, with little sleep might be taking its toll. Feel dizzy, like I'm okay, but clumsy, perpetual tipsy feeling. Supposed to meet some friends at Thursday Party at midnught. I've not decided yet. Headed to the grocery store. Mum dad, i'm okay :) don't worry. Despite above, I am being responsible and Seoul is very very safe, really. I think about Day 2 a lot, still.
