I just started being confident with my Japanese. Now I have to restart. "Thank you" and "sorry" being my staples. Getting to the room was quite easy. Lots of English everywhere. Made a friend too :) Out of all things in Korea, I settled with Nachos. Although, in my defence, i'm often feeling nauseous since arriving in Asia. Probably a mix of stress, new foods (?), and an awful sleep schedule.
