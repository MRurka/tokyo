Packed up and moved to Hongdae. Second hostel is much different, and more communal. Met a cool American who's lived in Japan for 2 years. Also met lots of Swedes. All of them with blond hair.. Of course. I can confirm the stereotype. Also one korean. Hongdae is filled with students. The young vibe is nice. Itaewon is full of Americans and international. Much more Korean here, will be fun. Picking up the language pretty easily too. I can say 

- thank you
- hello
- excuse me
- sorry
- fuck
- very (offensive) 
- hot
- cute
- pretty
- beautiful 
- you are
- i want this please (formal)
- delicious 
- awesome 
- awesome (food)
- please
