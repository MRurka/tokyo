cap-1:	Met Yasuyo that morning with 2 of her friends, hanging outside in front of the  SevenEleven. Was her last day at SevenEleven. Met her briefly the day before during my daily sandwich breakfast and canned coffee runs. One of her friend quit the week before, and her to her friend's last day was (tomorrow). She took me to a famous Soba place. Literally a 4 minute walk from the hostel. How convenient. Super tasty. Super tasty. Yasuyo also helped me set up my Line account. Line is like the KakaoTalk of Japan. Though I have limited access because I'm a foreigner and I can't figure it out.

cap-15:	Green Tea ice cream bar. Amazing. Amazing. As always. If I didn't walk so much, I'd be fat. Though, diabetes is still a possibility! Fingers crossed xx.

cap-22:	This is the bottom level. Legend has it Lady Gaga partied here when she came. Upon further investigation (dancing), i am sceptical. It's a great place, but I wouldn't think it's Lady Gaga great.

I said how interesting you never see trash bins on the streets. In Seoul and Tokyo. When you do, it's a sight. From what I am told, there is a stigma for eating and walking. Although you can drink and walk. Many recycle bins. "Says something about their culture, eh?" I said. "Says something about ours", said Miles. And how true (and accidentally wise). You really do learn about your own culture when you experience others. Korean Microwaves are amazing. Always hated western Microwaves. Now I really hate them. Korean Microwaves literally have only 2 knobs. Not 30 buttons, with 1000 different designs, with different rules. 

He also advises you tell the ladies "eat ma booty" Apparently they like it. Real pickup artist. I'm kidding obviously. We joke.

This night was fun. I wrote the above on my way to Shibuya, the day after. I am writing THIS in the future, about the less future. 

Karaoke was quite an experience, I thought I was an okay signer, but yikes. When you don't have Michael Bubl√© singing with you, it's a lot harder than one thinks. But it was fun, letting go, being the party pumper. That's my thing, I guess. I bring out the shy dudes and girls. Ironic that I should be the one to do so.
