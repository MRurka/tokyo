Observations:

- People who walk their dogs bring with them a squirt bottle, or water in a bottle, to rinse whatever the dog pees on. 
- People wake up early to sweep the streets and sidewalks of fall leafs, not only in front of their homes. 
- It's common to see very young kids walk to and from school alone, without the company of adults. 
- Bicycle culture is big here, and no one locks their bikes. Most of them have baskets - pouches to carry things, and many have multiple seats (2-3). You'll often see family bike rides! 
- Garage doors are wide open and apartment stairs are outside of the buildings.
- Crows are 1.5-2x bigger, and have a deeper caw, but without the choppiness. More like a lame horn.
