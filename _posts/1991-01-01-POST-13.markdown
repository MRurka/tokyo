I moved this day, from Itaewon to Hongdae. Not day 12. Met lots of Swedes. Had a brilliant meetup with Jane, a teacher. She has an interesting story.. Her parents are very strict, and she's planing to disown them, for very, very reasonable reasons.. Will have to quit her job, change number, unfriend family, literally run away, but in the same city, for now. Such an unfortunate situation. I can explain, just not here. We're hitting up the fish market for some -live- squid, and Guinness, on Sunday.
