img-23:	img_5473.jpg
cap-23:	Little bottle of 14% soju is $1.5 and tastes like a strong Canadian cooler. This was peach flavoured. Original soju is yuck yuck. Needless to say what happens next.

img-30:	img_5480.jpg
cap-30:	Roaming the city, looking for food.

img-31:	img_5481.jpg
cap-31:	Got (rightfully) shit on for saying cheers in Japanese. Cam-pie is Japanese, Gom-b√© is korean. Also taught me how to properly use chop sticks. The guy on the left runs a food van business. korean BBQ is fuuuuucking delicious. 

img-32:	img_5482.jpg
cap-32:	The Koreans left, Aaron ans I continued to this random bar. Met some more foreigners. Tequila, of course.

img-33:	img_5483.jpg
cap-33:	Then we went to this bar, called Thursday Party. They check ID at this bar, and i didn't bring mine so Aaron gave me his (he had two, which looks severely not at all like me..) tried it and it worked! Dude didn't even look at it. Half the time they read the cards, other half they just need to see the intention and let you in.

img-35:	img_5485.jpg
cap-35:	et some very great people! Hmm. Dog was chasing cat. cat didn't like dog. Cat had friends. Fox enters, worked with friends of cat, gain trust, join the pack. Fox likes cat. Then fox and friend makes dog go away. Fox is hero. Enters pug. Pug and Fox go get a drink. Fox returns to pack and pack is gone. Fox is frantic. Fox really like cat. Fox asks and find out they go to Gold Bar. Fox has no more money. Fox runs home, gets money. Runs to Gold Bar. Gold Bar checks ID. Stupid fox no bring ID. Fox runs back home, get ID. Fox runs back to Gold Bar. Pack not there. Fox alone. Fox didn't quit. Fox look around outside, frantic, and miraculously, finds pack down the street. Fox talks with pack. Cat give Fox phone number. Fox wins. ---------- Lesson learned- In the face of hopelessness, perseverance and a little blind hope must be involved to achieve when the odds are greatly against you. I thought many times, shit, population of Seoul 9.5M... How find pack?? Give up? But I also knew that if I didn't find the pack, I would have been very sad for letting pack and cat go, and not trying would have made it worse. I thought to myself, the odds are shit, but if the future is going to be made, that is up to me and every minute I ran extra, every small thing I did, decision I took, to go left instead of right.. That was all me, and it felt good. I had to make my future.
