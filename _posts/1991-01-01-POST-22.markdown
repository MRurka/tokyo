cap-29:	This was conflicting. Initially, i thought, how awesome, Kamikaze!! More literally God of Wind. Kami (God) Kaze (Wind). I started wondering if it was offensive or insensitive because of what happened in World War II. Though, on our way home, many people smiled and chuckled at the sight. One girl gestured "eating noodles", with a smile. Hmm. Then someone on a bike said it was "cool". But I got home, read up on Kamikaze and I can no longer wear it. Doesn't feel right. Reading some excerpts from letters by Kamikaze pilots was the tipping point. A tradition of the Samurai, to write a poem of sorts before an act of suicide or profound commitment. Bushido.
